# Doors Game Engine
## About
The Doors game engine is a simple curses-based game engine, 
which makes creating a terminal-based game easy. The engine
is written entirely in C, and allows for custom world maps, 
animations, collision, and audio.

This project is a work in progress, and is not guaranteed to 
work. If you have any issues, please read the repository WIKI. 
Currently there is no UI, but rather just a development 
framework. There are plans to create a simple map-maker app in
the future, however plans are subject to change.

## Build
Currently, you can buid the engine using:
"gcc doorsEngine.c --lncursesw"
You must have the ncurses library installed in order to build.
